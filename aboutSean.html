	<h1> All About Sean</h1>
	<h2> Biography </h2>

	<p> I've had a few pets throughout my life. My first pet was a dog, named Nikki. She was a female, but I have no clue what breed she was. She looked like a fox. My second pet was a little hermit crab I got at a street fair. I wasn't expecting him to live long but he lived for a few months which was a pleasant suprise. I named him Houdini because he would always escape his tank. After that, we adopted a stray cat we named Casey. I had her for a few years until she passed away from cancer a year ago. Finally, my current pet is my hamster, Naomi. She's a young energetic girl, but shes still a bit shy around me, as I've only had her for 2 weeks now.
